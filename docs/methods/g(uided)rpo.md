# GRPO: Guided Reward Policy Optimization for LLM Fine-Tuning

**GRPO (Guided Reward Policy Optimization)** is an RL-based approach for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing structured or “guided” reward signals to improve instruction-following, safety, and multi-step reasoning capabilities.

---

## 1. What is GRPO?

GRPO is a method to fine-tune LLMs using **guided rewards** instead of relying solely on scalar rewards or pairwise preference comparisons. The guiding signals can come from:

- Human feedback (e.g., good/bad labels or stepwise evaluations)
- Smaller LLMs generating intermediate feedback
- Programmatic or heuristic scoring functions

The core idea is to **provide richer, structured guidance** so the model learns efficiently, avoids reward hacking, and handles complex multi-step tasks.

## 2. How GRPO Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Start with a Pretrained LLM**  
   The base model has general knowledge but may not follow instructions optimally.

2. **Collect Feedback / Guidance**  
   - Can be human-annotated, LLM-generated, or heuristic-based.  
   - May include **stepwise intermediate rewards**, not just a final score.

3. **Policy Optimization**  
   - Treat the LLM as a policy: `input -> response -> guided reward`.  
   - Update the model to maximize **expected guided reward**, optionally including KL divergence to the base model.

4. **Iterate**  
   - Repeat feedback → policy update → evaluation until convergence.

5. **Optional Safety Mechanisms**  
   - KL penalty to prevent the model from drifting too far from the base model.

## 3. Reward Signals in GRPO

- **Flexible:** Can use human annotations, LLM feedback, heuristics, or combinations.  
- **Structured:** Can be stepwise or multi-dimensional, tracking reasoning steps, factual correctness, coherence, safety, or style.  
- **Adaptive:** Guided reward signals reduce sparse or ambiguous reward issues present in standard RL methods.

---

## 4. KL Penalty in GRPO

- **Purpose:** Ensure fine-tuned model doesn’t drift too far from the base model, maintaining fluency, factual grounding, and stability.  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Often adaptive or applied per intermediate step.  
  - Can be soft or measured via embedding similarity.  

**Objective function example:**

\[
\max_\pi \; \mathbb{E}_{x \sim D} \Big[ R_{\text{guided}}(x, \pi(x)) - \beta \, \text{KL}(\pi(\cdot|x) \parallel \pi_{\text{ref}}(\cdot|x)) \Big]
\]

Where:  
- \( R_{\text{guided}} \) = guided reward (human + LLM + heuristics)  
- \( \pi_{\text{ref}} \) = base model policy  
- \( \beta \) = KL regularization coefficient  

---

## 5. Advantages of GRPO

- Faster convergence with fewer samples.  
- Reduced risk of reward hacking.  
- Flexible and expressive reward shaping (multi-step, hierarchical, multi-objective).  
- Handles complex instruction-following, multi-step reasoning, and safety-critical tasks.  

---

## 6. Limitations / Things to Watch

- Requires high-quality guided rewards; noisy or biased signals can harm performance.  
- Computationally heavier than simple preference-based methods.  
- Designing stepwise or structured rewards requires careful planning.  
- Less standardized tooling compared to PPO or DRPO.

## 7. Comparison with PPO and DRPO

| Method | Reward Type | Offline/Online | KL Penalty | Notes |
|--------|------------|---------------|------------|-------|
| **PPO** | Scalar reward (learned RM) | Online RLHF | ✅ Yes, explicit | Stable, widely used, but risk of reward hacking |
| **DRPO** | Pairwise preference | Offline | ❌ No | Simple preference-based offline method |
| **GRPO** | Guided / shaped reward (scalar, stepwise, vector) | Offline or online | ✅ Yes, adaptive/local | More expressive and structured rewards, reduces reward hacking |

---

## 8. Example Use Cases

1. **Multi-step reasoning tasks**: math problems, coding, multi-step planning.  
2. **Safety-critical tasks**: medical advice, legal guidance, regulated instructions.  
3. **Long-horizon tasks**: summarization of long documents, multi-turn dialogues.  
4. **Complex instruction-following**: recipes, multi-step API workflows, simulations.  

---

## 9. Relationship to DRPO

- GRPO can be seen as an **extension of DRPO**, both are offline methods.  
- DRPO uses simple **preference comparisons**.  
- GRPO adds **explicit, structured, and guided reward signals**, including stepwise feedback, making learning more efficient and controlled.

---

## 10. Summary

GRPO is like **DRPO with a smarter teacher**: instead of just saying “better or worse,” it **guides the model at each step** with informative feedback. The KL penalty ensures the model remains grounded in the base model’s knowledge, while guided rewards accelerate learning and reduce reward hacking.
